# Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks

Welcome to this project on **Handwritten Digit Classification**! This repository demonstrates how to use a **neural network** to classify handwritten digits (0-1). The neural network is trained on a dataset of 20x20 grayscale images and is capable of recognizing and classifying the digits 0 and 1 from the images. Dataset is from MNIST

## What’s Inside?

In this project, you’ll find:

- **Data Preprocessing**: We load and process the dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Neural Network Model**: A simple feedforward neural network built using TensorFlow and Keras, with two hidden layers and an output layer using softmax activation.
- **Training the Model**: We train the model to recognize the digits 0 and 1 from the pixel data.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated, and visualizations of the results are provided.

## Key Features

- **Input Data**: 1000 training examples of handwritten digits, with images of size 20x20 pixels.
- **Model Architecture**: A neural network with:
  - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
  - An output layer with a softmax activation to convert logits into probabilities.
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**:
